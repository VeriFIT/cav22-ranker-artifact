This directory contains the automata used in experimental evaluation.
In addition, the CSV files in the directory contain classification of the types
of the automata.  The CSV files can be obtained by running the script in
util/classify_file.sh with the corresponding input file, e.g.,

$ util/classify_file.sh bench/from_ltl_red.input
